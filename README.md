This website project for Pet Care Store was given by my professor in Web Technology class. 

I hosted this website on Netlify and the link is here https://sunny-beignet-445e33.netlify.app/.

In this website, I have created HomePage, About, NewsFeed, Pet Services, Login and Register Button with the help of HTML and CSS.

Home Page: It dispalays the homepage of website with the basic dtails about name of company and its location as well as contact details.
About: It displays the contact details of the owner.
NewsFeed: It will show the available items in the store for the pets.
Pet Services: It will show the pet servicesavailable in that store.
